# DeepLearningLab

Here are my solutions to the assignments of a practical course I took on Deep Learning. The code for each assignment, along with a short report, can be found in their respective folders. The topics were:

* **Assignment 1** : Train a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the MNIST dataset
* **Assignment 2** : Train a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset
* **Assignment 3** : Train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent on the Car Racing environment of OpenAI Gym using imitation learning.

The code is based on TensorFlow.
